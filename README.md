### ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
My contact details, incl. E-Mail, are available on the [BBAW website](https://www.bbaw.de/die-akademie/mitarbeiterinnen-mitarbeiter/hamster-ulf).
Drop me an E-Mail if you are interested to collaborate (e.g., write a thesis or paper, just coding for fun, etc.).
Or just open an issue in any repository, you are interested in.

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

**German Morphology**
- *flexion* : Applying declination and conjugation rules to lemmata for German; 
  see [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/flexion);
  the purpose would be to develop a rule-based synonym replacement algorithm, 
  e.g., to generare surrogate data for GAN training.

**Phonetics, Text/IPA/Audio**
- *ipasymbols* : A simple JSON database to lookup the properties of IPA symbols;
  see [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ipasymbols)
- *tonbeleg* : An audio data donation WebApp written with Vue3, Ionic6, and Firebase. 
  The MVP was coded by students from TU Darmstadt;
  see [github](https://github.com/linguistik/tonbeleg)


### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

**Sparse Matrices Operations**
- *sparsity-pattern* : Generate different types of sparsity pattern for sparse matrices;
  see [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/sparsity-pattern)
- *keras-spconn* : Experimental keras classes with sparse matrices (instead of dense matrices or pruned methods) and dynamic sparsity training routines; *code under development*

**General Neural Network stuff**
- *Batch Correlation Regularizer* for ResNet skip-connections; *code publication in progress*
- *Correlated Outputs Regularization* for regression tasks; *code publication in progress*
- *keras-quadopt* : Solving quadratic optimization problems with Keras; 
  see [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/keras-quadopt/)

**Graphs & trees**
- *node-distance* : Compute distance between all nodes of a tree, and estimate an histogram that can be used as features for other models; 
  see [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/node-distance)
- *treesimi* : Compute similarity between trees, e.g. dependency trees;
  see [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/treesimi/)

**Time-Series / Sequences**
- *Multi-label embeddings* :  An input token can be a list of IDs instead of just one ID;
  see [TF2/Keras](https://pypi.org/project/keras-multilabel-embedding/)
  or [PyTorch](https://pypi.org/project/torch-multilabel-embedding/)
- *Pad Sequences with multiple features* ; 
  see [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pad-sequences)

**Ranking**
- *bwsample* : Sampling and evaluation of Best-Worst Scaling sets; 
  see [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/bwsample) 
  or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bwsample)
